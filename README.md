# HaploPhen

Association of Haplotype blocks to Phenotypes using machine learning

A tool to test the association of variants in haplotype blocks to phenotypes

* Call variants using any platform (RNASeq, Exome, Whole Genome or SNP Arrays)
  * Group variants by haplotype blocks to compute SNP load in each haplotype block
  * Associate haplotypes with phenotype ...

## Data sources
