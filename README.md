# HaploPhen

Association of haplotype blocks to phenotypes using machine learning methods

A tool to test the association of variants in haplotype blocks to phenotypes

![alt text](concept.png)

## Method
   * Call variants using any platform (RNASeq, Exome, Whole Genome or SNP Arrays)
   * Group variants by haplotype blocks to compute SNP load in each haplotype block
   * Associate haplotypes with phenotype ...

## Data sources

   * LD BLocks : Non-overlapping LD blocks derived from 1KG data (hg19) were obtained from : Approximately independent linkage disequilibrium blocks in human populations,Bioinformatics. 2016 Jan 15; 32(2): 283â€“285 [doi:  10.1093/bioinformatics/btv546]. Using NCBI's online remapping tool these regions over mapped to GRCh38 with merge fragments turned ON to make sure each LD block is not fragmented

   * RNASeq samples: Initial training set from healthy and disease samples were obtained from SRA. The disease sample selection query was: (AML) AND "Homo sapiens"[orgn:__txid9606] NOT ChIP-Seq. The healthy sample selection criteria was: ...

## RNASeq Variant Calling Pipeline

   * RNASeq sample reads were aligned using HiSat2
   * Variants were called using GATK version
   
## Association Tests

   * We are exploring standard differential gene expression methods from Bioconductor
